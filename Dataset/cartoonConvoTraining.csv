835,"(Yeah, me too.)
",NO
836,"It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me.
",NO
837,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
",NO
838,"Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
",NO
839,"You guys, you guys.
",NO
840,"What?
",NO
841,"Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
",NO
842,"Like what?
",NO
843,"Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.
",NO
844,"Okay, did he touch you here? 
",NO
845,"NO!
",NO
846,"Did he ever do this? How about this? 
",NO
847,"My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
",NO
848,"Hello there, children!
",NO
849,"Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
",NO
850,"Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
",NO
851,"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
",NO
852,"(Like what?)
",NO
853,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
",NO
854,"Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
",NO
855,"(Yeah! I think...)
",NO
856,"Yeah!
",NO
857,"All right, come on guys!
",NO
858,"May I help you.
",NO
859,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
",NO
860,"Right this way. 
",NO
861,"Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-
",NO
862,"Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.
",NO
863,"Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!
",NO
864,"Tally ho!
",NO
865,"Indeed!
",NO
866,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
",NO
867,"What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!
",NO
868,"...Huh?
",NO
869,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
",NO
870,"Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?
",NO
871,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
",NO
872,"Brainwashed.
",NO
873,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
",NO
874,"I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
",NO
875,"Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.
",NO
876,"Doctor, do you have- children?
",NO
877,"Why, yes, I have two young boys.
",NO
878,"He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
",NO
879,"So what can we do??
",NO
880,"I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.
",NO
881,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
",NO
882,"Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?
",NO
883,"All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!
",NO
884,"Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.
",NO
885,"This isn't working.
",NO
886,"Well let's... give it some more time, kids. 
",NO
887,"Would you like to daaance???
",NO
888,"No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
",NO
889,"Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
",NO
890,"Come here, chubby. 
",NO
891,"Wait a minute.
",NO
892,"He's remembering.
",NO
893,"Children! What have I done?
",NO
894,"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!
",NO
895,"I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
",NO
896,"Come on, Chef! You can do it!
",NO
897,"We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!
",NO
898,"Oh Jesus, here we go.
",NO
899,"Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
",NO
900,"We don't wanna hear it.
",NO
901,"You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.
",NO
902,"Immortal.
",NO
903,"He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. 
",NO
904,"...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
",NO
905,"Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
",NO
906,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
",NO
907,"Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. 
",NO
908,"We're not leaving without Chef.
",NO
909,"Chef, we love you.
",NO
910,"I'm sorry children. 
",NO
911,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
",NO
912,"Get the hell out of here, children!!
",NO
913,"Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO! 
",NO
914,"Chef! 
",NO
915,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
",NO
916,"Yeah.
",NO
917,"He's right. 
",NO
918,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
",NO
919,"Is it working? Is it working?
",NO
920,"Yes. We've got a pulse!
",NO
921,"You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
",NO
922,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
",NO
923,"Hey, is that a hybrid?
",NO
924,"Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
",NO
925,"Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!
",NO
926,"Thanks.
",NO
927,"Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
",NO
928,"Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
",NO
929,"What?!
",NO
930,"Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  ""Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler""
",NO
931,"Dad, can we go home, please?
",NO
932,"Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
",NO
933,"But Dad, I want-
",NO
934,"Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
",NO
935,"Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 
",NO
936,"What's this? 
",NO
937,"Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
",NO
938,"Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
",NO
939,"All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 
",NO
940,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
",NO
941,"Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
",NO
942,"Yes, it certainly is.
",NO
943,"We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
",NO
944,"Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
",NO
945,"Righ!  Okay, good.
",NO
946,"And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
",NO
947,"What??
",NO
948,"We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 
",NO
949,"Yeah? 
",NO
950,"Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
",NO
951,"Going away party? What do you mean?
",NO
952,"Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
",NO
953,"Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
",NO
954,"Well he is.
",NO
955,"Where's the going-away party?
",NO
956,"At Cartman's house.
",NO
957,"Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
",NO
958,"Hey Eric, where's Kyle?
",NO
959,"Who? 
",NO
960,"Kyle, the person leaving.
",NO
961,"Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
",NO
962,"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!
",NO
963,"Kyle? Kyle!
",NO
964,"Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
",NO
965,"What?!
",NO
966,"I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
",NO
967,"Well? What do you think, huh? 
",NO
968,"Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.
",NO
969,"Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. 
",NO
970,"Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.
",NO
971,"Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
",NO
972,"Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood?
",NO
973,"Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
",NO
974,"Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.
",NO
975,"You in here, Peter?
",NO
976,"Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis
",NO
977,"Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan
",NO
978,"Hello.
",NO
979,"We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?
",NO
980,"Yeah. That's right.
",NO
981,"Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner.
",NO
982,"Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
",NO
983,"Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.
",NO
984,"Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.  Ahhh,  ahh,  ahh.  We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco
",NO
985,"Yeah. We sure are.
",NO
986,"Come on, people. Come on, people now. 
",NO
987,"Dude, what are you doing?
",NO
988,"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
",NO
989,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
",NO
990,"Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
",NO
991,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
",NO
992,"All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with ""Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already"". 
",NO
993,"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
",NO
994,"He's right. 
",NO
995,"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
",NO
996,"Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?
",NO
997,"Thanks. 
",NO
998,"Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? 
",NO
999,"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl""
",NO
1000,"Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
",NO
1001,"Good for you!
",NO
1002,"Thanks!
",NO
1003,"At least we're smart enough to know better!
",NO
1004,"Thanks! 
",NO
1005,"Come on, everybody be people now
",NO
1006,"And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! 
",NO
1007,"If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.
",NO
1008,"Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
",NO
1009,"Great speech!
",NO
1010,"Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.
",NO
1011,"Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song.
",NO
1012,"Yeah.
",NO
1013,"Uhh! 
",NO
1014,"Ow!
",NO
1015,"Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!
",NO
1016,"Smug?
",NO
1017,"Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!
",NO
1018,"This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
",NO
1019,"It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
",NO
1020,"Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?
",NO
1021,"No! Hello, how are you?
",NO
1022,"Really good, really good. 
",NO
1023,"Hey there. Alan, right?
",NO
1024,"Actually, it's Alain
",NO
1025,"Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
",NO
1026,"Can I just get an empty glass?
",NO
1027,"Oh. Sure. 
",NO
1028,"Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. 
",NO
1029,"So... what do you do for fun?
",NO
1030,"We drink and take drugs.
",NO
1031,"Do you want some acid?
",NO
1032,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
",NO
1033,"You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
",NO
1034,"Everything okay in here, Kyle?
",NO
1035,"Yeah, fine, Dad.
",NO
1036,"So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
",NO
1037,"Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
",NO
1038,"I want three.
",NO
1039,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
",NO
1040,"You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
",NO
1041,"I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
",NO
1042,"The smug?
",NO
1043,"The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  Now take a look at this. 
",NO
1044,"What is that?
",NO
1045,"It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
",NO
1046,"George Clooney's acceptance speech?
",NO
1047,"Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.
",NO
1048,"We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
",NO
1049,"What about San Francisco?
",NO
1050,"Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
",NO
1051,"If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. 
",NO
1052,"Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! 
",NO
1053,"Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 
",NO
1054,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
",NO
1055,"I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
",NO
1056,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
",NO
1057,"I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
",NO
1058,"But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
",NO
1059,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
",NO
1060,"I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
",NO
1061,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
",NO
1062,"All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!
",NO
1063,"Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
",NO
1064,"They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!
",NO
1065,"Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.
",NO
1066,"Butters, are you there?!
",NO
1067,"I'm here, Eric.
",NO
1068,"I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
",NO
1069,"You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
",NO
1070,"Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
",NO
1071,"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
",NO
1072,"Turning right at O two four niner. 
",NO
1073,"That's it. That's that the last one.
",NO
1074,"Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!
",NO
1075,"Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us.
",NO
1076,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
",NO
1077,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
",NO
1078,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
",NO
1079,"Being smug is a good thing. 
",NO
1080,"Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
",NO
1081,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
",NO
1082,"And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.
",NO
1083,"No...
",NO
1084,"Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
",NO
1085,"What?
",NO
1086,"It's a miracle!
",NO
1087,"Kyle!
",NO
1088,"Hey Stan.
",NO
1089,"Dude, what happened?? 
",NO
1090,"We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
",NO
1091,"It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? 
",NO
1092,"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
",NO
1093,"So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
",NO
1094,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
",NO
1095,"And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
",NO
1096,"NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
",NO
1097,"But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
",NO
1098,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
",NO
1099,"You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
",NO
1100,"Yeah!
",NO
1101,"I'm...  I'm not ready...
",NO
1102,"I don't think I can do it either.
",NO
1103,"It's simply asking too much.
",NO
1104,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
",NO
1105,"Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
",NO
1106,"Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
",NO
1107,"Yeah, I guess so.
",NO
1108,"Ah, that's better. 
",NO
1109,"But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
",NO
1110,"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
",NO
1111,"Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
",NO
1112,"Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
",NO
1113,"AWWW!
",NO
1114,"How could Family Guy do that?
",NO
1115,"Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
",NO
1116,"Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
",NO

",NO

",NO

1136,"Hey there, Knight Rider. 
",NO
1137,"Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
",NO
1138,"Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.
",NO
1139,"Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain?

",NO
1162,"You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
",NO
1163,"Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.
",NO

",NO
1172,"Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat
",NO
1173,"Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!
",NO

",NO

",NO
1206,"I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
",NO
1207,"Thank you, Mayor.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it.
",NO
1208,"So how do we do that?
",NO
1209,"No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. 
",NO
1210,"I like the sand idea.
",NO
1211,"Yeah, me too.
",NO
1212,"Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 
",NO
1213,"We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
",NO
1214,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
",NO
1215,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
",NO
1216,"Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
",NO
1217,"Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
",NO
1218,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
",NO
1219,"But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
",NO
1220,"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
",NO
1221,"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
",NO
1222,"Yeah.
",NO

",NO

",NO

",NO

",NO

",NO
1244,"What is it regarding?
",NO
1245,"O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. 
",NO
1246,"Dude, can I go before you?
",NO
1247,"""Family Guy"" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. ""Family Guy"" isn't funny.
",NO
1248,"Osama bin Laden had this to say:
",NO
1249,"If you look closely at the writing in ""Family Guy"", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.
",NO
1250,"Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. 
",NO
1251,"You one of them?
",NO
1252,"Who?
",NO
1253,"So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
",NO
1254,"Not nicely.
",NO
1255,"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
",NO
1256,"Cool, man.
",NO
1257,"Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.

",NO
1259,"I'm a pretty bad kid.

",NO
1262,"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
",NO
1263,"You got it, man. You got it. 
",NO
1264,"Seeya.
",NO
1265,"I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.
",NO
1266,"Couldn't you throw them in prison? 
",NO
1267,"Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!
",NO
1268,"And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?
",NO
1269,"Uh you know, the right to free speech.
",NO
1270,"Mr. President, when your administration came up with this ""First Amendment,"" did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? 
",NO
1271,"Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.
",NO
1272,"What do you intend to do about this ""First Amendment,"" Mr. President? 
",NO
1273,"Forgive me, Mr. President, but this ""First Amendment"" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob? 
",NO
1274,"Yeah!
",NO
1275,"That's right!
",NO
1276,"Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.
",NO
1277,"Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode
",NO
1278,"All right, let's get this over with. 
",NO
1279,"Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
",NO
1280,"Oh, poor kid.
",NO
1281,"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
",NO
1282,"I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
",NO
1283,"Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again.
",NO
1284,"Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
",NO
1285,"I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.
",NO
1286,"What was that?
",NO
1287,"I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. 
",NO
1288,"Thanks a lot for the ride.
",NO
1289,"Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!
",NO
1290,"I'll do everything I can.
",NO
1291,"The network president's office is in there! 
",NO
1292,"Oh thanks, dude.
",NO
1293,"No problem, man.

",NO
1295,"Hello Mitchell.
",NO
1296,"Oh hi, Miss Travis.
",NO

1298,"Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
",NO
1299,"It won't take long, sir.  Ow...
",NO
1300,"All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.
",NO
1301,"Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
",NO
1302,"Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.
",NO
1303,"Wha?  What are they?
",NO
1304,"That isn't gonna work on them.
",NO
1305,"Why not?
",NO
1306,"Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
",NO
1307,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
",NO
1308,"I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? 
",NO
1309,"We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.
",NO
1310,"Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
",NO
1311,"You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!
",NO
1312,"Twenty-five minutes.
",NO
1313,"I gotta hurry! 
",NO
1314,"How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
",NO
1315,"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
",NO
1316,"Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.
",NO
1317,"I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
",NO
1318,"Well what about the new waiter?
",NO
1319,"The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.

1323,"Everything okay here?
",NO
1324,"Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!
",NO
1325,"I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
",NO
1326,"Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.
",NO
1327,"Huh? Why not?
",NO
1328,"Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels.
",NO
1329,"Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
",NO
1330,"No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel.
",NO
1331,"Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
",NO
1332,"But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.
",NO
1333,"All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before?

",NO
1341,"Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.
",NO

",NO
1403,"Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?
",NO
1404,"Why?
",NO
1405,"We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to ""heighten"" certain things to make the book more relevant to people.
",NO
1406,"Hey yeah.
",NO
1407,"Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?
",NO
1408,"Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.
",NO
1409,"See you tomorrow.
",NO
1410,"All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 
",NO
1411,"Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah.
",NO
1412,"But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
",NO
1413,"Yeah. That's why you should only get a little high.
",NO
1414,"Well, maybe just a little high.

",NO
1432,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  ManBearPig. 
",NO
1433,"ManBearPig? 
",NO
1434,"It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say ""Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome."" The end.
",NO
1435,"Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.
",NO
1436,"Thank you, class. Excelsior!

1442,"Okay, Mr. Marsh. 
",NO
1443,"Be safe. 
",NO
1444,"Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
",NO
1445,"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
",NO
1446,"ManBearPig?
",NO
1447,"He's half man and half bearpig
",NO
1448,"No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
",NO
1449,"That doesn't make any sense.
",NO
1450,"He could be half bear, half manpig.
",NO
1451,"Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
",NO
1452,"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
",NO
1453,"Hello?
",NO
1454,"Hello, this is Al Gore.
",NO
1455,"Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
",NO
1456,"I was the vice president.
",NO
1457,"I know.
",NO
1458,"Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.
",NO
1459,"Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
",NO
1460,"Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.
",NO
1461,"No, no, it's not that.
",NO
1462,"Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial!  I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.
",NO
1463,"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
",NO
1464,"No you don't.
",NO
1465,"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
",NO
1466,"Are you serial?
",NO
1467,"...Yes, I'm serial.
",NO
1468,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
",NO
1469,"(Yeah, I don't get it.)
",NO
1470,"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
",NO
1471,"Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?
",NO
1472,"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
",NO
1473,"What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??
",NO
1474,"NO.
",NO
1475,"Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.
",NO
1476,"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
",NO
1477,"Oh my God!  ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! 
",NO
1478,"Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
",NO
1479,"Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
",NO
1480,"Ah I don't think so, dude. 
",NO
1481,"Yeah, we've got school anyway.
",NO
1482,"I can get you all excused from school. 
",NO
1483,"You... have that kind of power?
",NO
1484,"Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
",NO
1485,"Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?
",NO
1486,"Yeah.
",NO
1487,"Let's go cavin'. 
",NO
1488,"Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
",NO
1489,"Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?
",NO
1490,"Ahh, no.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's...
",NO
1491,"All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.
",NO
1492,"What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
",NO
1493,"Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.
",NO
1494,"These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named ""The Hanging Mushroom.""  And over here we have ""Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls.""  And finally, of course, the ""Two Sisters.""  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.
",NO
1495,"Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
",NO
1496,"Not yet.
",NO
1497,"All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name. 
",NO
1498,"Kids! Kids, over here! Look.
",NO
1499,"What?
",NO
1500,"I bet this is where he's hiding.  This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on!  Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! 
",NO
1501,"In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. 
",NO
1502,"Wow...
",NO
1503,"Take a picture of the sound, Steven. 
",NO
1504,"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
",NO
1505,"Hello?
",NO
1506,"Help!
",NO
1507,"We're trapped in here!
",NO
1508,"Somebody get us some help down hyah!
",NO
1509,"Hello, help!
",NO
1510,"Hello??
",NO
1511,"(Hello!)
",NO
1512,"Help!
",NO
1513,"Forget it! They can't hear us!
",NO
1514,"(What are we gonna do??)
",NO
1515,"Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
",NO
1516,"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
",NO
1517,"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
",NO
1518,"That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
",NO
1519,"Aw, dude! 
",NO
1520,"The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area. 
",NO
1521,"Does anybody know who these kids are?
",NO
1522,"No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.
",NO
1523,"Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!
",NO
1524,"What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
",NO
1525,"I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
",NO
1526,"What's that? 
",NO
1527,"What is that, a pigbearman?
",NO
1528,"No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!
",NO
1529,"I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
",NO
1530,"They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
",NO
1531,"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
",NO
1532,"All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
",NO
1533,"C-Cartman?
",NO
1534,"Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
",NO
1535,"Dude, what are you doing?
",NO
1536,"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
",NO
1537,"Dude, get away from me!
",NO
1538,"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
",NO
1539,"Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!
",NO
1540,"Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?
",NO
1541,"I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!
",NO
1542,"Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.
",NO
1543,"You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
",NO
1544,"This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!
",NO
1545,"(We're almost there!)
",NO
1546,"I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
",NO
1547,"Yes you do! 
",NO
1548,"No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
",NO
1549,"Ruuun! 
",NO
1550,"That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
",NO
1551,"You're calling off the rescue?
",NO
1552,"We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
",NO
1553,"Well what if the children aren't dead?
",NO
1554,"Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there. 
",NO
1555,"Nothing left alive...  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.
",NO
1556,"Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
",NO
1557,"Grab my hand.
",NO
1558,"Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
",NO
1559,"I can't kick!
",NO
1560,"Yes you can!
",NO
1561,"I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
",NO
1562,"I need your help!
",NO
1563,"No, you just have to save me. 
",NO
1564,"Kyle! No!
",NO
1565,"We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.
",NO
1566,"Oh Jesus, here we go again. 
",NO
1567,"I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.
",NO
1568,"Agh.
",NO
1569,"Oh my God! 
",NO
1570,"It's the kids! 
",NO
1571,"They're alive! 
",NO
1572,"Kids! I saved you!
",NO
1573,"Kids completely out of control. 
",NO
1574,"Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!
",NO
1575,"It's time to call Nanny 911.  We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis.  Parents of America, help is on the way!  Tonight...
",NO
1576,"Mom, I need another energy drink! 
",NO
1577,"This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
",NO
1578,"And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. 
",NO
1579,"It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! 
",NO
1580,"Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.
",NO
1581,"Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.
",NO
1582,"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 
",NO
1583,"And you must be Eric.
",NO
1584,"Mom, I want a Twinkie.
",NO
1585,"All, all right dear. 
",NO
1586,"Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
",NO
1587,"Ha! Hahahahahaha
",NO
1588,"I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
",NO
1589,"No thanks, I'd rather naught.
",NO
1590,"Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. 
",NO
1591,"All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
",NO
1592,"Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
",NO
1593,"Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
",NO
1594,"Because you took my Xbox.
",NO
1595,"Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
",NO
1596,"Well, yeah.
",NO
1597,"And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
",NO
1598,"Yeah. I guess so.
",NO
1599,"See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
",NO
1600,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
",NO
1601,"Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
",NO
1602,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
",NO
1603,"Oh, I just never had kids.
",NO
1604,"Why not?
",NO
1605,"It... just... didn't happen.
",NO
1606,"You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
",YES
1607,"That's it!  I'm not doing this!
",NO
1608,"Oh, but we really need some help. 
",NO
1609,"Find yourself another nanny... television show!
",NO
1610,"Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. 
",NO
1611,"This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
",NO
1612,"Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.
",NO
1613,"I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
",NO
1614,"What do you mean?
",NO
1615,"I mean,  she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. 
",NO
1616,"Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.
",NO
1617,"Oh, that's very interesting.
",NO
1618,"I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
",NO
1619,"I'm not fat!
",NO
1620,"Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
",NO
1621,"Well, no, I don't.
",NO
1622,"Go on, take your son for a walk.
",NO
1623,"Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 
",NO
1624,"Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.
",NO
1625,"Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 
",NO
1626,"Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
",NO
1627,"Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
",NO
1628,"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
",NO
1629,"Tsst. 
",NO
1630,"Mom!
",NO
1631,"Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!
",NO
1632,"And now, back to the Dog Whisperer.
",NO
1633,"It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
",NO
1634,"It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
",NO
1635,"But what if he does run away.
",NO
1636,"Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 
",NO
1637,"Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 
",NO
1638,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
",NO
1639,"You can't stay here.
",NO
1640,"Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
",NO
1641,"You'er not staying at my house either.
",NO
1642,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
",NO
1643,"No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
",NO
1644,"Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
",NO
1645,"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
",NO
1646,"Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
",NO
1647,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
",NO
1648,"Who is your best friend?
",NO
1649,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
",NO
1650,"What's my last name?
",NO
1651,"All right, I'm back.
",NO
1652,"Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.
",NO
1653,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
",NO
1654,"Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
",NO
1655,"That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
",NO
1656,"Cesar...
",NO
1657,"How is the painting going?
",NO
1658,"Oh look it came back.
",NO
1659,"Yup, just like you said he would.
",NO
1660,"What is he still doing here?!
",NO
1661,"He said he's hungry. What should I do?
",NO
1662,"Well let's feed it.
",NO
1663,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
",NO
1664,"This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
",NO
1665,"Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
",NO
1666,"Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
",NO
1667,"Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
",NO
1668,"Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 
",NO
1669,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
",NO
1670,"You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.

1671,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-

",NO
1676,"Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
",NO
1677,"I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 
",NO
1678,"Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command.
",NO
1679,"Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
",NO
1680,"This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
",NO
1681,"I am the pack leader! 
",NO
1682,"Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
",NO
1683,"Sounds divine!
",NO
1684,"Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
",NO
1685,"So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
",NO
1686,"Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
",NO
1687,"That's greeat!
",NO
1688,"The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
",NO
1689,"Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
",NO
1690,"There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
",NO
1691,"Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
",NO
1692,"Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 
",NO
1693,"Dude, have you lost more weight?
",NO
1694,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
",NO
1695,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
",NO
1696,"Dude, we're not killing your mom.
",NO
1697,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
",NO
1698,"Where am I supposed to get a gun?
",NO
1699,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
",NO
1700,"I'm not shooting anybody.
",NO
1701,"I love you, sweetie.
",NO
1702,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 
",NO
1703,"Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
",NO
1704,"How is the child doing?
",NO
1705,"Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
",NO
1706,"That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
",NO
1707,"You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
",NO
1708,"Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
",NO
1709,"Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
",NO
1710,"No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 
",NO
1711,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
",NO
1712,"Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
",NO
1713,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
",NO
1714,"Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
",NO
1715,"Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
",NO
1716,"Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 
",NO
1717,"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
",NO
1718,"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
",NO
1719,"The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.
",NO
1720,"Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?
",NO
1721,"We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!
",NO
1722,"There has to be...someway we can help them.
",NO
1723,"What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?
",NO
1724,"Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!
",NO
1725,"But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
",NO
1726,"It is not an option!
",NO
1727,"What is this sword?
",NO
1728,"Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.
",NO
1729,"But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
",NO
1730,"But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.
",NO
1731,"Who foretold this prophecy?
",NO
1732,"Soltzman. He's an accountant.
",NO
1733,"Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.
",NO
1734,"All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!

1740,"Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?

1741,"15 agility.

",NO
1747,"So what?
",NO
1748,"So what?! 
",NO
1749,"We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.
",NO
1750,"Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online.
",NO
1751,"I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?
",NO
1752,"No, I have a life. 
",NO
1753,"Give me the sword.
",NO
1754,"You?
",NO
1755,"I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
",NO
1756,"We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
",NO
1757,"Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works!

",NO
1778,"What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
",NO
1779,"Oh yeah.
",NO
1780,"Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
",NO
1781,"Got it.
",NO
1782,"And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like-  Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.
",NO
1783,"All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 
",NO
1784,"What's a urinal?
",NO
1785,"A wall toilet for peeing in.
",NO
1786,"Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
",NO
1787,"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
",NO
1788,"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
",NO
1789,"Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!
",NO
1790,"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
",NO
1791,"But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
",NO
1792,"But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
",NO
1793,"That sure is a mystery.
",NO
1794,"Yeah, it sounds super-hard.
",NO
1795,"Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
",NO
1796,"Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
",NO
1797,"My clue is kind of pointing this way.
