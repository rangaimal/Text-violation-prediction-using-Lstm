"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
"
"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
"
"They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
"
"Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
"
"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
"
"No, son. We... like to sleep in.
"
"Two hostages come front and center! 
"
"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
"
"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
"
"So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
"
"We can't fight them, Cartman.
"
"No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
"
"Country Kitchen Buffet?
"
"Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
"Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
"
"Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
"
"Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
"
"I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
"
"Yeah!
"
"All right!
"
"(Woohoo!)
"
"Aw yeah!
"
"We did it! 
"
"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
"
"Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
"All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!
"
"All right!
"
"Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
"
"Huh??  Heck no! This is goin' too well.We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!
"
"Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?
"
"Come on, everyone! It's time to plan for Phase 2!  What the heck?  Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open!
"
"It's not open? It has to be! 
"
"Try a window.
"
"They're blocked from the inside.
"
"No...  Let us in! Let us in!
"
"Open the door! It's six a.m. 
"
"Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!
"
"You have to let us in! 
"
"All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages.  That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country. 
"
"Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?
"
"Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks.
"
"Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?
"
"Sir, what should we do with this one?
"
"It's up to the townspeople.
"
"Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
"
"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
"
"Huh?
"
"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
"
"That's right.
"
"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
"
"I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.
"
"Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
"
"Sure. I'll drive.
"
"That's our Grandpa. 
"
"Dude, I hate my family. 
"
"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
"
"Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
"
"Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
"
"(Yeah.)
"
"Who's joking? 
"
"You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
"
"You have AIDS?
"
"No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!.
"
"Wow! Casa Bonita?!
"
"(Woo-hoo!)
"
"What's Casa Bonita?
"
"Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and  all kinds of stuff!
"
"It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
"
"This Saturday! Awesome!  Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere.  Casa Bonita!
"
"Who said I'm inviting you? 
"
"You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
"
"Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
"
"Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
"
"Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
"
"Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
"
"I have never been a dick to you.
"
"Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
"
"Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
"Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!""
"
"Okay, except maybe for that one time.
"
"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
"
"Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
"
"Sorry, my mind's made up.
"
"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
"I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
"
"Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
"
"I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
"
"No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
"
"Hi Kyle. 
"
"That isn't it, Cartman.
"
"What isn't it?
"
"That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
"
"...I don't understand the difference.
"
"I know you don't. 
"
"Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
"Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
"
"Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?
"
"Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
"
"Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
"
"Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
"
"Like what?
"
"Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
"
"Who's there?
"
"Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?"" 
"
"Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
"
"Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
"
"Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
"Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! 
"
"Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
"
"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
"
"(Yeah!) 
"
"Hey Kyle.
"
"Well?
"
"Well what?
"
"How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
"
"I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
"
"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
"
"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
"
"I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
"I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
"
"Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
"
"I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
"
"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
"
"Good.
"
"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
"
"Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
"
"What's this all about, Eric?
"
"Butters, can you keep a secret?
"
"Well, sure I can!
"
"For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
"
"Nnn-how terrible?
"
"A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
"
"What?? 
"
"Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
"
"I just see stars. 
"
"Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
"
"Nope, uh I don't see any...  Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
"
"Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
"
"It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
"
"Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
"
"When do you think uh it'll get here?
"
"I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
"
"What??
"
"According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
"
"Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
"
"No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
"
"Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
"
"Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
"
"AAAAHH! 
"
"Oh Jeez!
"
"Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
"
"Oh God! Oh Jesus! 
"
"All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
"
"But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
"
"No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
"Are you sure?
"
"I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
"
"But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
"
"Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
"
"Oh God, oh God!
"
"Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
"
"Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
"
"Yeah, screw him. Let's go.  Oh, finally! 
"
"Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
"
"Oh. Thanks, dude.
"
"Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
"
"Oh wait. Cartman.
"
"Yes?
"
"Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
"
"Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
"
"I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"
"Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
"
"All right, let's go.
"
"Okay, boys. Get in the car.
"
"Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
"
"Oh, hello Chris, Linda.
"
"Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
"
"Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
"
"We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but...  Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. 
"
"Oh Butters!
"
"Aw dude, weak.
"
"Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
"
"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
"
"Yeah, it's kinda weird.
"
"Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
"
"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
"
"Yeah.
"
"That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
"
"Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
"
"Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. 
"
"Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
"
"I'll drive you boys. 
"
"Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"
"All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for:  Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.
"
"""Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square...""  Hello?  Hello??
"
"Butters!
"
"Hwaaaah!!
"
"Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
"
"Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
"
"The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
"
"What about my parents. Did you see them?
"
"There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. 
"
"Oh my God, let me see!
"
"No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
"
"How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
"
"We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
"
"Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
"
"Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
"
"Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.
"
"All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
"
"Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
"
"Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. 
"
"What what what?
"
"I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! 
"
"UUuuugh!! 
"
"But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
"
"Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
"
"Who's coming this way?
"
"The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
"
"Oh God! I hate cannibals!
"
"They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
"Noooo!
"
"We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
"
"But I can't see nothin'.
"
"Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
"
"Are we out in the destruction?
"
"Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
"Aw man.
"
"All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
"
"Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
"
"Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
"
"We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
"
"Whoa!
"
"Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
"
"Whaaat??
"
"It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
"
"AAAAHH!
"
"We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
"
"Waaaaaah!
"
"Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? 
"
"Ooohhhh!
"
"Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh!  Die! 
"
"Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
"
"The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
"
"Oh no!
"
"We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
"
"Uh w-where??
"
"Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
"
"Aren't you coming?
"
"Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
"
"Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
"
"I love you too, man. I just  You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! 
"
"Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"
"Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
"
"We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
"
"Really?
"
"Yeah, it's pretty cool.
"
"""Pretty cool."" So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
"
"Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
"
"What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
"
"Happy Birthday to you. Happy- 
"
"Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. .
"
"You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
"
"Hello? 
"
"HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?
"
"With what?
"
"You're not a cannibal, are you?
"
"No
"
"Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
"
"Kid, what are you doin' here?
"
"I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
"
"Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.
"
"Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
"
"No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.
"
"Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
"
"We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
"
"Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together.  Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone.  Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great!  Boys, they found Butters.  He's okay.
"
"Oh, awesome.
"
"I knew he'd turn up.
"
"Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why?  Oh really? 
"
"What?
"
"Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you.  Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. 
"
"What?
"
"Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
"
"But... Casa Bonita.
"
"I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
"
"But I...  but...  Stand back!
"
"Cartman, stop it!
"
"I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! 
"
"It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
"
"Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
"
"Cartman!
"
"Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
"
"Cartman! 
"
"All right, kid! End of the line!
"
"Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!
"
"Jesus Christ! 
"
"Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
"
"Totally. 
"
"Okay, children, let's take our seats.  We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. 
"
"Hello everybody. It's relly great to meet you all.
"
"Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.  He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.
"
"I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!
"
"Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
"
"Yeah, screw that kid!
"
"All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? 
"
"Hey. My name's Gary.
"

"And this is my brother Mark.
"
"Hi!
"
"My sister Jenny.
"
"Hey!
"
"My little brother Dave.
"
"Hi!
"
"And my baby sister Amanda.
"
"Hello Stan!
"
"Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!
"
"What's that?
"
"That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
"
"No.
"
"Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!
"
"Oh yeah!
"
"All right! Let's play! 
"
"Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge.
"
"My family!

"
"Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? 
"
"All right! Go Dave!
"
"Yeah!
"
"Woohoo! 
"
"Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? 
"
"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! 
"
"That's a great story, Sarah.
"
"All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!
"
"All right!
"
"Yeah!
"
"Woohoo! OOWW!
"
"The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
"
"You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
"
"Who's Joseph Smith? 
"
"Only the most important person in the world.
"
"You've never heard of him?
"
"No!
"
"Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.
"
"Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.
"
"All right, you rascals. Gather round.  Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.
"
"Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
He started the Mormon religion
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"There goes that kooky Joseph Smith
"
"You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.
"
"Well, how do you know he didn't?
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Joseph Smith was called a prophet-
"
"Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.
"
"Well it's true. I did.
"
"Where?
"
"I was out in the woods, praying  I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me.  And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right.  And that's exactly how it happened.
"
"You see? You believe it now?
"
"Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up?
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Many people believed Joseph
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And that night he-ee saw an angel
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"And please bless Mother and Father, and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies.  AAAHH!  Oh my gosh!
"
"I am Moroni. I am a Native American.
"
"A...  Native American?  But your skin is white.
"
"Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ.
"
"Jesus live here in America?
"
"Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today. 
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny. 
"
"Wooww... 
"
"Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"And we all know what happened then, don't we?
"
"Yeah! I know!
"
"What happened then? 
"
"Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done!
"
"Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!
"
"Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!
"
"Awesome! I can't wait!
"
"Yeah! 
"
"You coming, Stan?
"
"No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
"
"Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. 
"
"Bye Stan!
"
"Great to meet you!
"
"Bye!
"
"...Hello?
"
"Oh, hi Stan.
"
"Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
"
"Who?
"
"Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!
"
"The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
"
"Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
"
"That's not what the Harrisons said.
"
"Who are the Harrisons?
"
"The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
"
"Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
"
"They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
"
"We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
"
"But that's just you and your friends.
"
"I said shut up, turd!
"
"Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
"
"All right, that does it!
"
"Where are you going?
"
"I'm gonna go have a talk with this ""Mr. Harrison.""  If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! 
"
"Randy, don't cause trouble.
"
"Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
"
"Yeah.
"
"Jyeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! 
"
"God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
"
"Hello!
"
"Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?
"
"I sure am.  The, the name's Gary.
"
"Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
"
"Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!
"
"Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
"
"Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!
"
"Well, thanks. Uh...
"
"Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.
"
"With chocolate frosting
"
"Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six. 
"
"I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.
"
"I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.
"
"Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
"
"Uh huh?
"
"You know. About... God, and stuff.
"
"Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.
"
"Well, I-
"
"Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.
"
"We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyuone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!
"
"Well, no, no, I just-
"
"You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said ""Who the heck do these people think they are?!"" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.
"
"Y-you can call me... Randy.
"
"Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.
"
"To each his own, right?
"
"Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honist, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
"
"Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.
"
"I found them! I found them!  You're not gonne believe it, everybody! I found them!
"
"Found what?
"
"Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!
"
"What? What did he say? Are you crazy?
"
"Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. 
"
"Maybe there isn't anything out here.  Wait a tick!  What's this?  Wow...
"
"Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing .
"
"This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!
"
"Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.
"
"Well, so where are they?
"
"Where are what?
"
"The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
"
"Oh. Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"Wow, amazing!
"
"He found the stones and golden plates
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Even though nobody else ever saw them
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
"
"Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
"
"See? That's what happened to me!
"
"Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
"
"What are you talking about?
"
"Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
"
"That's what they made me think, too!
"
"All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
"
"Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
"
"Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
"
"Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
"
"Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
"
"What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
"
"Hey Stan.
"
"Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
"
"Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one.  I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.
"
"Wow, you made this?
"
"Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
"Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? 
"
"Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
"
"Oh here comes my family now!
"
"Hey you guys! 
"
"Look, we painted our faces! 
"
"I'm a lion. 
"
"I'm an alien. 
"
"Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? 
"
"Oh my God...
"
"You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?
"
"Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
"
"Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?
"
"Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!
"
"We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.
"
"Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.
"
"Yeah. Have a good time, boys. 
"
"Let's go.  Our faces are painted. 
"
"Wow!
"
"So what do you guys wanna do?
"
"Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
"
"Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
"
"Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. 
"
"So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!
"
"Yyeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
"
"Sure.
"
"What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
"
"Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.
"
"Yeah, but... how?
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"What's this all about, Mr. Smith?
"
"Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?
"
"Well, sure I can.
"
"I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.
"
"In America?  Really? That sounds kind of...
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.
"
"Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?
"
"With these. 
"
"Rocks?
"
"They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here.  I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.
"
"Really?
"
"Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.
"
"Wow! 
"
"Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. ""And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites.""
"
"And that's how the Book of Mormon was written
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.
"
"One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
"
"I wanna watch TV.
"
"We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
"
"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
"
"And?  Your turn, Sharon.
"
"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
"
"Yes.
"
"But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
"
"Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
"
"Hey everybody.
"
"Wow, what a great house!
"
"You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet youuu!
"
"And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.
"
"My brother is a stupid turd.
"
"Hey Stan.
"
"Hey Gary.
"
"Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
"
"Dad!
"
"Ohohoho, really? Wel, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!
"
"Yeah! Woohoo!
"
"Ooo, what's that?
"
"Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?
"
"Yeah.
"
"See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.
"
"Martin went home to his wife
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.
"
"Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?
"
"Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Smart smart smart smart smart
"
"Why would he make it up?
"
"Martin Harris dumb dadumb-
"
"All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages.  If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.
"
"Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem. 
"
"Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Martin Harris dumb.
So Martin went on back to Smith
Said the pages had gone away
Smith got mad and told Martin
He needed to go pray
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.
"
"I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.
"
"He is??
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
"
"Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.
"
"Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.
"
"Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
"
"All right, Martin. Let's get to work! 
"
"And that's how it happened.
"
"Yeah! All right! 
"
"...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
"
"Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?
"
"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
"
"Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
"
"No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translatios were hidden!
"
"Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.
"
"I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
"
"Me neither.
"
"Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!
"
"Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.
"
"Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!
"
"Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
"
"Yeah! 
"
"Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!
"
"Yeah! All right! 
"
"Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
"
"I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
"
"Oh no! You guys broke up?
"
"You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
"
"Hey Stan.
"
"Oh brother.
"
"Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
"
"Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.
"
"I don't?
"
"Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. 
"
"Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
"M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay?  M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, ""Butt Out!"" 
"
"Butt out! Yeah yeah! Kids, that cigarette butt is gross!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go! 
"
"Oh no...
"
"Yeah! All right! Woohoo!!
"
"Hey students, how are we all feelin' today? Woooo! 
"
"Hey, did you guys know that each year over six hundred thousand people a year die from smoking? A year!
"
"Six hundred thousand?? Are you sure you're not just blowing smoke? 
"
"Blow smoke? Us? No way! Because we don't need to smoke and neither do you, right kids? Butt out! Break it down! 
"
"Butt out! Yeah yeah! It's cool to say no!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
"
"Smoking, no. No smoking. 
"
"Freestyle!

"Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the ""no"" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
"
"Pam!
"
"Dooooonttt smooooke.
"
"Woohoo! 
"
"You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
"
"Hey! What's the big deal? I like smoking, and it makes me cool! 
"
"Ohoh, really?? Do you think lung cancer is cool, too?? 
"
"What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? 
"
"And what about abortion, and AIDS? 
"
"Pfft! That's none's the cool.
"
"Word.
"
"Yeah. So butt out! 
"
"Butt out! Yeah yeah! Give that cigarette butt a throw!
"
"Ugh, Jesus Christ! 
"
"Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
"
"Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could grow up to be a failure.
"
"Worse yet, you could grow up to be dead. 
"
"So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you!
"
"Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
"
"Just Like Us. 
"
"Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
"
"Aw dude, this is really hard.
"
"Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. 
"
"Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
"
"Boys, what are you doing back here?  I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!

"Nothing.

"D'awww sick! 
"
"Gross dude! 
"
"Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
"
"No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
"
"Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer.  M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit! M'kay?! 
"
"Oh! Jesus Christ! 
"
"...Whoops.
"
"Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
"
"We're sorry.
"
"Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. 
"
"Oh God... 
"
"Come on in. 
"
"Stanley, what did you do this time?!
"
"You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
"
"Smoking?
"
"No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! 
"
"Mom...  Dad, it was just a-
"
"I don't have a son!
"
"Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
"
"Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
"Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
"
"Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
"
"Yeah. This is really their fault.
"
"No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
"
"Yeah, huh?  It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
"
"Oh my goodness, I had no idea.  Are you okay, sweetie?
"
"Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
"
"We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
"
"Who's Rob Reiner?
"
"I don't understand it. I pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art, I forced smokers out of bars and parks, but still I get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it.  Apparently, people still don't understand how bad smoking people is for them. Don't they know how dangerous it is to their health?  Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke?
"
"According to the letter, sir, the town has a tobacco company quite near them.
"
"Yeah, that must be it.  The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings,  they're the ones making music wanna smoke!  They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards!  This is war!!
"
"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
"
"Hwat??
"
"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
"
"Yeah, what's the problem?
"
"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
"
"Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
"
"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
"
"Here he comes! 
"
"Damnit.  Butter!  Butter! 
"
"What'd he say?
"
"Butter!!  Hello South Park!!  It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya!  These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, ""We fight fire with fire!"" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down! 
"
"Oh no...
"
"Alright kids, here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper.  Once you're inside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it?
"
"Got it! 
"
"But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
"
"Mm.  Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field.  The tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking. If we're gonna take them down, we've gotta lie right back!  Oh my God!  Excuse me!
"
"Yes?
"
"Would you mind putting that death stick out?!
"
"But, uh, this is a bar.
"
"Isn't smoking illegal in bars here?
"
"Not in Colorado
"
"Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?!
"
"Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax.
"
"Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii!
"
"I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii!
"
"Yuh your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!
"
"Isn't he awesome, you guys?
"
"What??
"
"Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
"
"All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars!  As soon as we get into the main facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it?
"
"Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
"
"Heh, great.  Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking. They are liars and they are frauds!
"
"Can I help you?
"
"Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour.
"
"Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco.
"
"Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.
"
"Well, come on in.  How about a little history first?  Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.
"
"Not if I were around, they wouldn't have.
"
"Excuse me?
"
"Oh, nothing! Please continue.
"
"The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612.  Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.
"
"So, tobacco helped to build America.
"
"That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.
"
"Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
"
"And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965,  when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about.
"
"That sound perfectly reasonable.
"
"And here's our factory at work. 
"
"With a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
"
"I like to have a cigarette every now and then 
It makes me fee-l calmer when the day is at an end. 
"
"And if it gives me cancer when I'm eighty I don't care
Who the hell wants to be ninety anyway?
"
"So with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
"
"Well, I guess that's the end of our tour.
"
"Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture.  Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now!
"
"What??
"
"I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner!  And you've just been Reinered! Come on boys, let's make our escape!  Don't you try and stop us! 
"
"Oh my God!
"
"Hoh boy, that was great, kids.
"
"Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
"
"Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned!
"
"This is how we get rid of smokers.  We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!
"
"Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
"
"Here you go Bob.  This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work.  Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands!  And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha! 
"
"But dude, you're making stuff up.
"
"You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.
"
"Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
"
"Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass.
"
"What?!  God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?!
"
"Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you.
"
"Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow!
"
"Wow, a commercial?
"
"And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go!
"
"God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
"
"Huh?
"
"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
"
"(Well yep, that's what I think.)
"
"Yeah, maybe you're right. 
"
"So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
"Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
"
"Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
"
"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
"
"Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
"
"Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
"
"What are you doing? 
"
"Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
"
"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
"
"Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
"
"Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the TelePrompTer here. 
"
"Heh, ho-okay. 
"
"Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this.  All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric.
"
"Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
"
"And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.
"
"Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?
"
"That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake.
"
"Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
"
"But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles.
"
"I'm not eating the cupcake.
"
"Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. You can be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake. 
"
"Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
"
"Hey! 
"
"What are you doing, Cartman?
"
"They're going to kill me! 
"
"Who's going to kill you?
"
"The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
"
"Well, get away from us then.
"
"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
"
"You guys have to help me!
"
"No dude, get away!
"
"Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
"
"Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
"
"If I go, you guys go!
"
"Daaaad!
"
"What?
"
"Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
"
"Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. 
"
"Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
"
"Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
"
"Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
"
"Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
"
"Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
"
"(Uh huh.)
"
"You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
"
"Oh all right.
"
"No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"
"Why?
"
"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
"
"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
"
"God-damnit! 
"
"Give us the child!
"
"We will not!
"
"There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business!
"
"Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
"
"Wait a minute, what?
"
"Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it! 
"
"Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
"
"Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!
"
"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
"
"Yup.
"
"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
"
"GOD-DAMNIT THERE'LL BE NO MORE SMOKING!!
"
"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
"
"You're right, boys, m'kay?
"
"Yeah. Let smokers smoke.
"
"Yeah!!
"
"Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! 
"
"I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!
"
"I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
"
"My goo! My precious goo! 
"
"So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
"
"No.
"
"Well then, you are grounded, mister!
"
"You too, Eric.
"
"Aw awww!
"
"Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
"
"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 
"
"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
"
"Right. What are we playing again?
"
"Football.
"
"Got it. 
"
"Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
"
"Wendy breaks up.
"
"What? 
"
"Wendy breaks up with you. 
"
"Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
"
"She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. 
"
"What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
"
"Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!
"
"Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
"
"Yeh-heah, right!
"
"God, you're so stupid! 
"
"What a whore! 
"
"Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
"
"Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
"
"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
"
"Why?
"
"'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
"
"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
"
"Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
"
"God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
"
"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
"
"'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
"
"What? That's no answer!  Go tell her to be more direct with me.
"
"No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
"
"Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!
"
"Hey Stan.
"
"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
"
"For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
"
"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
"
"She's what?
"
"She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
"
"...Okay.  Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. 
"
"Yeah?
"
"Stan says you're a cont... you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
"
"Well tell Stan to fuck off!! 
"
"Well?
"
"She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. 
"
"Over?  Jesus...
"
"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
"
"...Go away.
"
"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
"
"Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
"
"God, what a fag!
"
"Dude, not now! 
"
"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
"
"Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
"
"Well what do we do now?
"
"Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
"
"No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
"
"What's Raisins?
"
"Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you?  Right over here. 
"
"So you guys having a good time today?
"
"Uh huh...
"
"How about some more fun fries, guys?
"
"Okay... 
"
"Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
"
"Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.
"
"What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
"
"Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
"
"This place is awesome!
"
"How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
"
"Hey guys.
"
"Whoa!
"
"How are we doing this afternoon?
"
"Good.
"
"I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
"
"W-we are.
"
"So what can I get you?
"
"Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts  and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
"
"Great. I'll put your order in right now. 
"
"You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
"
"Raisins, girls! 
"
"Woohoo!
"
"Oh Yeah!
"
"Do it!
"
"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
"
"Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
"
"Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
"
"Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your hat. I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn't have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? 
"
"YMCA...  YMCA-A.
"
"Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
"Have you ever noticed how much sand there is at the beach? I mean, haven't you ever wondered where all this sand came from? Omigod, this one time, I saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!
"
"Can we go, please?
"
"Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 
"
"Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much for coming to Raisins! 
"
"Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?
"
"Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
"
"Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
"
"When do you wanna see me?
"
"As soon as possible!
"
"Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. 
"
"Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! 
"
"Waa... ahaaah... 
"
"Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!
"
"Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
"
"No, dude, I feel worse!
"
"Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
"
"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
"
"She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
"
"I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
"
"What are you doing?
"
"Something I should have done a long time ago. 
"
"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
"
"Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
"
"Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
"
"If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play  Peter Gabriel.
"
"Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes.
"
"Lexus! 
"
"Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie.
"
"I waited all night for you to get off work.
"
"Oh, really?  Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury...
"
"I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
"
"There a problem?
"
"Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
"
"Right. 
"
"Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? 
"
"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
"
"Oh wow. Thanks, cutie.
"
"It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. 
"
"Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you.  Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? 
"
"Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
"
"Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? 
"
"O-kay!
"
"Bye, cutie!
"
"Bye, bye darling!  Wow... a real-life relationship.
"
"All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 
"
"Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
"
"I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
"
"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
"
"There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
"
"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
"
"Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
"
"Life is pain. Life is only pain.  We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings.  But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that  eats at your soul.
"
"Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?
"
"My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner.  Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
"
"They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders. 
"
"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
"
"Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. 
"
"All right, so how do I join you?
"
"If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.
"
"...'K.
"
"Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.
"
"Okay.
"
"First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. ""Hey,  cutie.""  When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun.  We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins.  Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. ""Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in."" If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. ""I'll be right back with your order, guys."" 
"
"Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.
"
"Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck.  Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!
"
"Okay! 
"
"Hi, welcome to Raisins!
"
"Hi! Is Lexus here?
"
"Hey, cutie.
"
"Darling!
"
"How are we doing today?
"
"Oh God. I missed you so much.
"
"Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.
"
"Yeah, happiness dies. 
"
"Yeah.
"
"All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.
"
"There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
"
"Whoa.
"
"The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
"
"Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
"
"They're not?
"
"No, dude! You can't say ""I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms.""
"
"Make it ""I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades.""
"
"Henrietta! Hi sweetie!
"
"Go away Mom! Leave me alone!
"
"Daddy and I just got your birthday present! But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!
"
"You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
"
"Ee-you are so creative, honey.
"
"Conformist bitch.
"
"Yeah.
"
"Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?
"
"Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
"
"Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
"
"Hey Lexus.
"
"Hi, sweetie! Who's this?
"
"Wuh it's me, Butters.
"
"Oh, okay. Hi, cutie.  Hey sweetie.  So how are you, honey?
"
"I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
"
"Good, good.
"
"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
"
"Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie.  Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
"
"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
"
"Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
"
"Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
"
"'K sugar. Gotta run.
"
"Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
"
"Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
"
"O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. 
"
"Uh but I spent it all.
"
"What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
"
"On my girlfriend.
"
"Girlfriend?
"
"You... have a girlfriend, Butters?
"
"Yeah.
"
"And she's... a... girl, right?
"
"Yup!
"
"Well all right! Good for you, Butters!
"
"Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
"
"Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
"
"Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
"
"Okay. 
"
"You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.
"
"All right, you win.
"
"Hey, can we get more coffee over here?
"
"Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?! 
"
"Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.
"
"Yeah.
"
"Dude, you haven't drank your coffee. 
"
"Well I don't drink coffee.
"
"You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. 
"
"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
"
"Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
"
"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
"
"So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
"
"Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole?  You just don't know what real pain is.
"
"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
"
"I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
"
"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
"
"What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
"
"Yeah. She is.
"
"Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
"
"For sure.
"
"Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
"
"...conformist.
"
"Yeah.
"
"Here we are, Mom and Dad! 
"
"Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
"
"Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
"
"Great.  Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way. 
"
"Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls calendar for five dollars? 
"
"Woohoo, all right, yeah! 
"
"Stephen, what is this place?
"
"I, don't know.
"
"Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. 
"
"Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! 
"
"Hey cutie, you having a good time?
"
"Yeah.
"
"Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.
"
"This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
"
"Hi guys. Can I take your order?
"
"Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.
"
"I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?
"
"No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
"
"I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.
"
"... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
"
"Cool! 
"
"Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
"
"Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
"
"Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?
"
"Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
"
"Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
"
"Huh?
"
"You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
"
"Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
"
"What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
"
"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
"
"I'm sorry, sweetie.
"
"So that's it? We're broken up now?
"
"I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. 
"
"Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
"
"Look at this. Another tortured soul. Another life of pain.  Hey Raven, check it out. 
"
"Butters?
"
"Oh  Uh hey, hey Stan.
"
"What's the matter with you?
"
"Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
"
"Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
"
"Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
"
"That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
"
"Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
"
"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
"
"Huh? But you just got dumped
"
"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
"
"Yeah.
"
"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
"
"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
"
"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
"
"Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
"
"Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
"
"Hey, can I join in? 
"
"What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
"
"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
"
"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
"
"Yeah. Let's play ball.
"
"Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov
"
"I gotta go tinkle.
"
"No Ike! Shh!
"
"Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.
"
"We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart.  I'll get it. 
"
"Gerald Broflovski?
"
"Yes?
"
"My name is Harry Gints and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.
"
"Yes, I can tell.
"
"My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption.  We were told that you might be the-
"
"Peter!  Oh God, Harry! It's our son!  Peter, it's Mommy.
"
"Gerald, what the hell is going on?
"
"I I'm not sure.
"
"It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.
"
"So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart.  Oh it's so good to see him.
"
"Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gints, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
"
"I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.
"
"What?
"
"We want to take Peter home, to Canada.
"
"Are you crazy?!
"
"Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
"
"Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.
"
"The new Canadian Prime Minister?
"
"Look, Ike is our son now!
"
"He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.
"
"I think you'd better leave.
"
"Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.
"
"Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
"
"We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!
"
"Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
"
"I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.
"
"Yes!
"
"Yes!
"
"No!
"
"Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"
"Gerald, do something!
"
"There's nothing I can do.
"
"Good-bye, Ike. You...  be a good bye, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. 
"
"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
"
"Come on, Peter, we should get going.
"
"No!
"
"Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.
"
"No no no no no!
"
"I have some chocolate.
"
"Chocolate! 
"
"We're going to take good care of him.
"
"You'd better!  Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? Iif he knew the situation, he might e-
"
"Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
"
"Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
"Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
"
"Guys.  Guys, I need your help.
"
"Sure dude.
"
"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
"
"We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
"
"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
"
"Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
"
"Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmastime.
"
"Dude, Cartman.
"
"I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
"
"I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
"
"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
"
"Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
"
"Three! Two! One!  Yaaaaay!
"
"As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
"
"How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? 
"
"Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you ""NO!""
"
"Rats!
"
"The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
"
"HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
"
"That's a great idea, Chef.
"
"What?
"
"Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
"
"Dad, don't get carried away.
"
"Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. 
"
"No! No, this can't be happening! 
"
"You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
"
"What?
"
"Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
"
"Whoa whoa, Cartman.
"
"It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
"
"Cartman, calm down!
"
"Is that true?
"
"It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
"
"This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
"
"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
"
"You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
"
"It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
"
"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
"
"We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"
"Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
"
"No business... Christmastime come anda nobody wanna eata Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close.  Oh boy! Some business!  Finally!  Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!
"
"Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
"
"Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease.  Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?
"
"Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
"
"Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a rot of money... hmlet's she. How many people?
"
"Four.
"
"Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a rot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred daura.
"
"How about fifty daura?
"
"Fifty daura?! You flighn to Canada cost at reast three thousand daura!
"
"Fifty-five daura.
"
"Hey! Stop wasting my time wa fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
"
"Okay. Sixty daura.
"
"Sixty-two daura.
"
"Okay.
"
"Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.
"
"Got it. 
"
"Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man.
"
"We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas.  That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
"
"Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine. 
"
"Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
"
"(Me neither!)
"
"Why not?
"
"('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)
"
"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
"
"You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
"
"Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
"
"Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
"
"Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Rooking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright. 
"
"All right! We're going to Canada!
"
"Sweet.
"
"Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh! 
"
"What's going on??
"
"Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to refrect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you bereive in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one. 
"
"Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
"
"Do something, Kyle! 
"
"I'm trying! 
"
"Look out!
"
"(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) 
"
"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
"
"Eh-xcuse me?  Uh, is this an invasion?
"
"No.
"
"Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion! 
"
"Hey! We're in Canada!
"
"Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
"
"Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!
"
"We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?
"
"What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?
"
"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
"
"His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
"
"Oh Jesus Christ.
"
"Hey! What the hell is going on?!
"
"It's Scott! AAAAHHHH! 
"
"Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
"
"Who's that?
"
"That's Scott! He's a dick!
"
"A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!
"
"Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!
"
"This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! 
"
"God, what a dick!
"
"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
"
"The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. 
"
"So how do we get to Ottawa?
"
"Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
"
"Which road?!
"
"This is Canada. We only have one road. 
"
"Follow the only road.
"
"Follow the only road.
"
"To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.
There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only road.
Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.
"
"And it's paved and wide and up to code.
"
"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
"
"Word!
"
"You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
"
"Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!
"
"Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
"
"Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
"
"Ahoy there, travelers.
"
"Who are you?
"
"I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie. 
"
"Baaaah.
"
"I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
"
"Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...
"
"Baaaah.
"
"But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
"
"You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
"
"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
"
"Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
"
"Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
"
"Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
"
"All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
"
"French Canada?
"
"There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
Ze ozer Canada is hardly Canada. If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.
"
"Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
"
"We have everyzing your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.
"
"Would you like a moustache?
"
"Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. 
"
"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
"
"Well first you must answer that phone.  Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
"
"We don't have time for this.
"
"You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call!  Ring-ring. Ring-ring. 
"
"Hello?
"
"Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine.
"
"How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!
"
"Okay, you can come with us.
"
"Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
"
"There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
And ze ozer Canada.
"
"Is a bullshit Canada
"
"It's not fair, Dad. Why should an animal die just because you and Moe are fighting?"
It's the law. My hands are tied.
"Okay, cranberry sauce, stuffing, potatoes. Come on, turkey. Join your friends."
Do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
I would.

Psst. Lisa.
Moe?
"Listen, I don't like you and you don't like me. But we both want to stop Homer from shootin' a turkey."
You don't like me? I like you.
"You do? Then I like you, too. Here, have a towelette."
"Here, turkey, turkey... Turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey, turkey..."
Nobody's gonna kill you.
"All right, from now on, no talkin'. If you want to signal me, use this bird call:"
Oh! Oh! Not the face!
"Ooh! Ooh! Okay, the face!"
"Oh, that actually feels good after the... after the crotch."

"All right turkey. Where are you? Turkeys, the only animal smarter than man."
What the hell is that?

A turkey!
Dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!
Not if I scare it away with this cougar call.
"You did it, Moe!"
"A cougar! Die, cougar!"
"My leg! Aww, geez!"
Got that cat right in the leg.
"Dad, you shot Moe!"
"Oh, no! This time I really am gonna faint!"
Son of a...

"How'd they get your bar back to normal so quickly, Moe?"
It's a snap when you use Certified Contractors.
Like the ones found in your local Yellow Pages.
Exactly.
"I'm sorry I shot you, Moe."
"Ah, that's okay. It's like my Dad always said, ""Eventually everybody gets shot."""
"Aw, I'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have Thanksgiving dinner together in this bar."
"Hey, who invited the hippies?"
"I did. You owe REM an apology for, eco-fraud."
"All right, I'm sorry... but I will not save the rainforest."
Good enough. Let's eat.
"And we should all be thankful to Michael, Peter and Mike for supplying this beautiful turkey, made entirely of tofu."
Tofu and gluten!
I'm thankful I ate before I came.
"Oh, come on, Bart. Smell those curds! Mmmmm, curds."
"And I'm thankful I get to spend Thanksgiving with my family, these alternative rockers, and my favorite bartender."
"Ah, here you go, pal."
And here you go.

I love Chinatown... although I wish they'd stop picking on Tibet Town.
Ooh... It must be Chinese New Year.
"Ah, people buy 'em when they're smaller and cute, then they flush 'em down the toilet."

"Uh, yeah. I'll have the shark butt with butt sauce."
Bart!
"Oh, excellent choice, sir."
Oh.
You're hired.
How is the Feast of Twelve Delights with Triple Happiness Sauce?
Very disappointing.
Then I'll have the sweet 'n' sour rice.
"Oh, very good. Would you like that with the fragrant bee bellies? Or the cat noses?"
"Neither, thank you."
Is there any way we can enhance your dining experience by hurting an animal?
No!

Fortune cookie.
"Ah. And now to read my fortune. ""Geese can be troublesome."" What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
Oh... Fortune means: Geese cause problems.
"Well, I knew that before I came in here. A guy outside told me that."
Every house has a bathroom.
"Oh, these fortunes are terrible."
Is there a problem?
"These fortunes are terrible. They're supposed to predict stuff, and ease you through times of doubt and sickness."
"Well, with all due respect, sir, I suppose you could come up with better fortunes?"
Easy.
Well?
You will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
That's not bad. Come with me.

Horrible.
"Ah, what am I doing here? I should be in New York writing riddles on Popsicle sticks. Then I'd be making a difference."
"Oh, they ruined my best fortune. I wrote ""Let a frown be your umbrella."" They changed it to ""Smile"". A frown is a much better umbrella than a smile. Try it."
This gentleman here can write better fortunes than all of you put together.
Show them.
"Okay, let's see... ""The price of stamps will climb ever higher."""

He is like a young me.
"Please, Yung Mee was a hack compared to this guy."
"Let's see. ""You will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" ""Your store is being robbed, Apu."" Are you getting all this, Lisa?"
I don't know.

You are a real winner. That fortune really nailed me... and my winning ways.

You will take a short sea voyage. Yarr. I'll enjoy that.

"Fourteen dollars and ten, eleven, twelve cents. There you go."
"You know sir, tipping is customary."
"Ooh, me sorry, me no speaky Chiny."
"Oh, General Gao... you were a bloodthirsty foe, but your chicken is delectable."
"Hm, this cookie feels heavy, as if there's some paper inside."
"Nice job, sir."
That was my thumb.
"Oh, there seems to be some sort of communiquÃƒÂ©."
"It's your fortune, sir."
"Capital! ""You will find true love on Flag Day."" Why it's Flag Day today! True love at last."
"Well, it's just you and me here, sir..."
"No time for jokes, Smithers! Come along. We're going womanizing."
Oh goody.

...So I foreclosed on her mortgage and took her cats!
"Oh Monty, it's such a delight to talk to you. I've gone five minutes without saying ""Well, I never!"""
Excellent. Let me fetch you another Thomas Collins.
"Damn that Pennybags. Between him and Scrooge McDuck, all the best ankle is taken."

Perhaps there's some girls in here.
Yes! It's going great!
"So, what are you into?"
"Great heavens! It's one of those nude female fire stations. Ohh, I'd always be second place to some kitten stuck in a tree. Let's go, Smithers. Smithers?"


"Oh, that fortune promised me true love. This has been the worst Flag Day ever."
That constable is ticketing my car!
I told you we should have parked next to the curb.
"Now see here, flatfoot..."
My goodness. You're beautiful.
"Oh, thanks, but I still gotta give you the ticket."
Of course you do. You can lift my wiper any day.
Is it still Flag Day?
"For twelve more seconds, sir."
"Miss, would you submit to a wooing by a gentleman caller?"
"Oh, I'm sorry, but you're not really my..."

"Well, okay..."
"Oh, frabjous day! She said ""yes""!"
He'll pick you up at seven. Wear a petticoat.
Petticoat?
Here's a place that rents 'em.

It's about time Mr. Burns found a woman. I can't stand to see a man single.
"Some people enjoy being alone, Mom."
No! Everyone should be paired up.
It wasn't meant to be.

"I've gotta be honest, Monty. I've never dated anyone who knew Calvin Coolidge."
"Well, I've never dated anyone with their original hair and teeth."
"You're a nice guy, Monty. You're always laughing and tenting your fingers. I like that."
Excellent.
And you're so upbeat. You think everything's excellent.
I really feel safe with you. It's like going out with my brother.
In... to?
"Yeah, like what's a fun day for a hundred and four year old?"
"Oh, I enjoy all the popular youth trends. Like, uh, mm...piloting motorcoaches... and, uh..."
Collecting dog waste.

"So, what shall we do tomorrow? Go grousing? Or if you'd rather stay home, you could sing while I accompany you on the clavichord."
"Actually, Monty --"
"Oh, I've got some wonderful stereopticon images of the Crimean war."
"Look, I had a lot of fun today, but I don't think we're right for each other. The age difference is just too--"
"Oh, balderdash! It's not important how old you are on parchment, it's how old you feel in the humors."
"I'm sorry, Monty..."
Stop that dog! It has my gum!
"Look, there's one of my young chums now. You there!"
"Yes, Mr. Burns."
Tell my young sweetheart here of our youthful exploits.
Ummm...
"Play along, Chubsy. There's a pie in it for you."
Oh! Yeah. Monty's a wild man! Yeah!
"Oh. He ran his own casino, stole the Loch Ness Monster, got shot by a baby, and blotted out the sun."
Wow! That was you?
"So, shall I pick you up at eight?"
Well...
"C'mon, he's a total player."
"Okay, stop kicking my door."
"Well done, young man. Your youthful trendiness will come in handy throughout the courting process. Because these days..."
Where did you get that pie?
Windowsill.

"New underpants? Homer, what are you up to?"
"Burns wants me to come along on his date, to show him where hip young people go."
"Well, don't look too hip. You don't want that girl falling for you."
You're right.
These would stop Joan Collins herself.

Drat! I wish that song were longer.
"I've gotta admit, you can really shake it."
"Oh, yes. That's totally voluntary."
"So, you guys come here all the time?"
"D-- Oh, uh, constantly. When we're not being kicked out for our rowdy, youthful behavior! Eh, pally?"
"Yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man Burns."
You mean young man Burns.
Put my hand on her knee.
"Yes, Mr. Burns."
I said her. And I said knee.
"Oh, sorry."

"I'm going to make such love to you that, oh, you'll forget all about Rudolph Valentino. Turn left here."
No problem.

"All right, you're dismissed. I'll take it from here."
"But Mr. Burns, you're exhausted."
"Yes, but I have a little secret. I've obtained a rare, powerful aphrodisiac."
"It was made from the pockets of the pocket fox, an animal that only existed for three weeks in the sixteenth century."
"Oooh! See you tomorrow night, Simpson."



That was amazing. I hope the kids didn't hear us.



Wow.

"Ah, Burns looks happy today."
"Heh. Watch me, uh, take advantage of his good mood."
Ooh.
"Uh, Mr. Burns, uh, can I have a raise?"
Clean out your desk. You're gone.
"Well, I had a good run."

"Ooh. Once again, my dear, you've beaten two strapping young bucks."
Excellent.
"Did you hear that? That ""excellent"" was... excellent."
Can I have some ice cream? I finished my pizza.
"In time, in time. I need to speak with you in private."
"Back in a moment, my dear. We have to, uh... uh... expel some urine."
You're going to ask her to marry you?!
Isn't it wonderful? I'm head over heels in love.
Are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
"Yes, my biological clock is ticking. I could be dead again soon."
"Wait, my dear. I think you'll find that red ball more ""engaging."""
Monty! It's beautiful.
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"Gloria, say you'll marry me."
"Oh Montgomery, of course I'll marry you."
"Oh, spectacular! Now we must celebrate -- I'll get some Champagne-iola."
This is the happiest day of my life. Nothing could spoil it. Absolutely nothing.
"Dum-dee-dum-dum-dum. Okay. Gun, check. Dollar-sign bag, check. Powerbar, check. All right, let's rob this..."
"Bowling alley? Okay, whatever."
All right. Totally st-- Gloria?!
Snake! I thought you were in prison.
I was. I told the guard that I was going out for a pack of cigarettes. Then I totally stabbed him.
"You're looking good, baby. Why did we ever break up?"
You pushed me out of a moving car.
Devil beard?
"The cops were chasing us. I needed to lighten the load. And um protect you. C'mon, baby. We can talk more at my hideout."
No! I'm engaged now!
My ring!
Let go of her or I'll scream!

Kaloo-kalei! We're in luck! They had a magnum at the shoe counter. Now for... Gloria?
Her ring!
Well she's run off... with Simpson!

"Well, this is my house. Ah--"
Uh-un.
"Ohh... Geez, I just wanted to escape."
"Gloria, you better tell your boyfriend to be a good little hostage."
"He's not my boyfriend, Mr. Burns is. Homer just comes along on our dates and carries us to the bedroom."
You're dating that old trilobite? Gross!
"We're in love, Snake."
"Don't say that, baby. I'm gonna win you back if I have to pistol whip this guy all night."
Pistol whip?!
Mmm... pistol whip.
"Local authorities are confident the killer bees are just curious and won't bother us if we don't bother them. On a serious note, two local residents have been missing for the last twenty minutes. We take you now live to Barney's Bowlarama, and the last man who saw them, C. Montgomery Burns."
"I don't understand. She was my young, sexy fiancÃƒÂ©e, he was my sexually virile best friend, and they just drove off in my Bugatti Sexarossa. How could this ever have happened?"
"Well, according to our Audience Insta-poll, forty-six percent say ""You're Too Old"", and thirty-seven percent say ""She's A Skank""."
Almost there.

"Wow, who do you have to kill to get a place like this?"
I think his name was Gustafson.

"You know, a little goatee thing."
Let me guess. Now you're going to start working him over with the brass knuckles. You Are so predictable.
You know what would be surprising? A foot massage.
Shut up!
Beating a man to a bloody pulp isn't gonna impress me
It used to. What if I beat him harder?
"Wow, you don't get it."
"Um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?"


"Don't worry, Mr. Burns. We'll track down Simpson with your vehicle's anti-theft system."
Car gone! Car gone!
We know that. W-Where has it gone to?
Car gone! Car gone! Car gone!
"Uh, Chief, this yokel says he saw Simpson driving out near Hickton."
Yuh-huh. My peepers don't lie.
"That's nice work, Lou. Lock 'im up."

"Hey, hey I want that lawyer what wears a cowboy hat."

"Release the girl, Simpson."
"I think I can take him out, Chief."
"O-oh, that's a sweet shot. He's tied to a chair."
That means Dad's not a kidnapper. He's a hostage.
"Get off my lawn, coppers! Or I'll totally turn the sprinklers on."
"Come on, Snake. You don't wanna soak all these people."
"We're in minute two of this standoff. What's the situation, Chief?"
"Well, we have an officer sneaking around the house, Kent. So, ah, unless they have a television in there or can hear my loud talking..."
It--
Ow! Ow! Ow!
"Well, I guess that answers that, doesn't it?"
"I swear I can change, Gloria. I'm taking classes in computer fraud."
Hmm...
"That's what you said about the telemarketing scams, but you didn't stick with it."
I don't like bothering people at home.
Good fire. Good fire. Keep burning. Almost there.
Just a little more.


My Gloria is still inside! Save her!
"Ah, it's too dangerous! Ah-- But I got a sister you might like. She's completely hairless, like those cats."
I don't care if she's Miss Hairless America... I'm spoken for. Now step aside -- I'll save Gloria myself.
"Y-- You? Ah, no offense, but you're a decrepit monkey skeleton."
"Perhaps, but this monkey skeleton is in love."
Who am I kidding? I'm just a feeble old man.
Gloria!
He did it! He saved her!
"Well, the important thing is, they're both safe."
"I know you've been through a lot, ma'am, but we need you to stand in front of the burning house and say ""Channel 6 is hot, hot, hot."""
"Wow, Mr. Burns, how did you do that?"
"Never forget, Homer, there's no muscle stronger than the human heart."
What about the wiener? A guy on TV lifted a can of paint with his.
Yes.
"Oh, Monty, you saved me. And to think, I was once in love with that dirty low-life..."
"With his arrogant smirk, gutter mouth, tough-guy attitude, macho tattoos, hair that can't be tamed, prison-sculpted body..."
Uh-oh.
"I'm sorry, Monty."
"Oh Snake, don't ever change."
"I don't get it, Simpson. I'm a bad boy."
"Oh, I know."
I'm absolutely evil!
"You're preachin' to the choir, man."
What do I have to do? Grow a devil beard?
You mean a Van Dyke?
"No, a Van Dyke has a mustache, doesn't it?"
I think it can.
Are you talking about a soul patch?
"No! Wait, maybe."

Putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. Fruit roll-ups for Bart... beer roll-ups for Homer...
"Burly?! I bought the wrong brand, Maggie!"
I'll just take them right back to the store and-- Whoa.
Look at those massive plaid shoulders.
Look at that absorbativity! I've gotta tell someone...
I came home as quick as I could. What's going on?
Watch what happens when I spill this blue liquid.
You pulled me out of school for this?!
Absolutely. You're about to get a lesson... in value!
And Burly's still got soaking power. Spill something else.
"Mom, I believe you."
Spill it...
"Ooo, Burly, you're insatiable."
Burly. You're so rugged and manly...
"Marge, a bee almost stung me today. I felt the wind go right by my ear."
"Oh, it's okay, Homie. The bee's all gone."
"Fantasize, Marge. Fantasize about Burly."
"Ooo, that's quite a hug, honey..."
"Hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! Well I can fantasize too."
"Ooo, Mama Celeste."
You touch-a me and I cut you.
"Homer, I'll tell you what I told Redford -- it ain't gonna happen."

"""Dear Burly, comma, I've never written to a registered trademark before. Are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? In either case, I would love a signed photo. Sincerely, Marge Simpson."""
"Love? ""Signed photo""?! Marge hasn't asked me for a signed photo in months! Well I'll show her!"
Hello?

We have a person-to-person call for Marge Simpson.
Person-to-person?!
"Hello. This is Chad Sexington, the model for Burly Paper Towels."
How did you get my number?
I don't know. But I was quite moved by your letter. I'd love to meet you and your family. Shall we say dinner?
"Oh, my goodness..."
Perfect. I'll be there at seven.
Oh my God! Dinner with Burly!

"Playing a prankeroo, eh?"
"I was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of Chad Sexington. Do you mind?"

"So, how was your day? Did anything unbelievable happen? Phone calls, things of that nature?"
You're not going to believe it. That paper towel lumberjack is coming here! For dinner! Tonight!
"Tonight? Well, you better get your hopes up."
I will!

That's him.
Oh my God!
"Why look, it's Chad Sexington!"
"Hey, Baby! I'm that guy you like!"
Barney? W-w-where's Chad--

"Congratulations, I feel ridiculous."
"You mean, I was just a prop in some cruel joke?"
Now you've done it. You really humiliated Mom.
"It was hard on me, too. I had to wear a suit. Oh, you're right. I've gotta make it up to her."
I suggest dinner and a show.
"How about Benihana, where dinner is the show?"
"No, huh?"
I guess it was a pretty funny prank. I like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
"Yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
"Okay, you've seen our next performer on Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin, and Art Linkletter's ""House Party"". Please welcome Mesmerino, The Hip Hypnotist!"
"Thank you. Thank you very, very much, ladies and gentlemen."
"Let's see, who do we have here?"
"Well, what's the matter with you, champ? You couldn't find a date?"
I didn't come here to be heckled and spoofed and whatnot.
"Well, why did you come here, seriously though? When I snap my fingers, my friend, you will be a make-out artist..."
Glayvin! That's a powerful... Hold it 'cause it's different. I--
"Hey, cupcake, listen good. I want you to swallow that gum and meet me in the coatroom in five, four, three, two, now."
"Whatever you say, Professor."
"Annnd, back you go."
"Ooh! The-- Hey! No, no. Don't make me... I don't wanna go back to the nothin'. I don't... Oh dear, I've re-dork-ulated!"
"Hey, smart move, four-eyes. Sittin' next to Skeletor here makes you look like Hercules."
Zing! What's a Skeletor?
"No, no, I kid. But seriously, it's very nice to see a young man take his father out for a night of hypnotism... before he dies."
"Actually, my father died a long time ago."
O-kay.
Is anyone here not a downer? Anyone?
Do me! Do me!
I am in your power. Boss me around.
"When I snap my fingers, you will transform into... a... famous historian."
"Look at me, I'm a famous historian! Out of my way!"
Thank you. Now you are... Emily Dickinson.
"Look at me, I'm Angie Dickinson! Out of my way!"
"Now, you are a young boy... ah, yourself, at twelve years old..."
I'm twelve years old... I'm with my friends. It's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... Oh my God!
"Do something, Mesmerino!"
"Ah, yes, yes. Um..."
"Oh, that's better..."
"Dad, what's wrong?"
We'd better get him home.

Here you go.



"Hmmm. And, Bart is set for the week."
"Oh, no..."

"Sorry, Mrs. S. He was kinda disruptin' things at work."
"Yeah, he ruined naptime and quiet time."
"Oh, Homey, you poor thing."
"Whoa, cool, he's still mental!"
"Yeah, my hunch is he's struggling with some sort of repressed memory."
How do we un-repress it?
"Well, the Yaqui Indians brew a special tea that unlocks memories."
It would be a good excuse to use my Yaqui tea set...

"Well, is anything coming back to you?"
Huh?... There have been so many classic Simpson moments. I remember that time I tried to jump over Springfield gorge...
"No Dad, everyone's sick of that memory!"
Try to remember back when you were twelve. Something frightening must have happened.
"Hm, twelve... Well, I remember I used to go hiking a lot with these two guys. With these two guys."

"It was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. And to kill the boredom, we sang."

"Hey, I thought we were called ""Lenny and the Jets""!"
BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM...
BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM BOM...
"MR. SANDMAN, BRING ME A DREAM..."
MAKE HIM THE CUTEST THAT I'VE EVER SEEN...
GIVE HIM THE LONELY HEART LIKE...
"Check it out, Fat Tony. Those jokers think they're the Cowsills."
...AND LOTS OF WAVY HAIR LIKE LIBERACE.
You guys have blundered into our secret tobacky patch.
Wow. Is that wacky tobacky?
The wackiest.
Let's punch and kick them!
Not so fast.
"Uh-oh, he's got a daisy!"
"We better scram. Eighteen more pumps, that could break the skin."
And that's how a troubled young Moe saved the day.

"Moe, what are you doin' here?"
"What am I-- My bar is empty, is what. Why ain't you guys there?"
We're trying to uncover a hidden trauma in my Dad's childhood.
"What? You mean that time he wigged out? Well, uh, gimme some of that Indian memory tea, there and I'll tell you all about it."
"Mmm, that's good Yaqui... Okay, that night we camped out under the stars..."

"Ah, look at all them stars. Buncha lazy lights. Don't do nothin' for nobody."
Hey you know what I'm lookin' forward to? The future. Have you heard about this internet thing?
Internet.
"Yes, the inner netting they invented to line swim trunks. It provides a comforting snugness."
"Hey, what was that?"
That's that nuclear plant they just opened.
"Yeah that's your future -- bustin' atoms. Can you imagine us workin' there, the whole Carl Crew?"
"Ah, you're both wrong. We're the Moe Syszlak experience, featuring Homer."
"Ah, I like the sound of that."
Friends forever.
"Ow! / Ow, that hurts! / Man we're stupid. / I hate you guys."

"The next morning, we went out to the old quarry to have a swim..."
You guys really gonna dive offa here?
Not me. I'm shakin' like a French soldier.
Yeah. I think I just logged onto my internet.
Only a moron would jump into that--

"And there's your whatchamacall repressed trauma. I mean, who likes getting muddy? It's terrible. Okay, let's go to Moe's now."
"Wait a minute. I remember falling in the mud, but I don't think that's why I've been screaming..."
Fine. Crap all over my theory.
Something else happened in that quarry... something... else...

Hey come on...

"Come on Homer, we're going to Sears to feel the bras."


You found a corpse when you were twelve? No wonder you've been so traumatized.
"It's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
"What I wanna know is, what the heck was that body doin' there?"
Maybe there's murder afoot!
Murder most foul?
Maybe.
"You know, if Dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there."
This sounds like a case that only the Simpson family can solve.
"Oh. Okay. Well, we'll just be going, then."
"Oh, hey, you guys can come with us."
"No, no, no. He said Simpson family. I mean, you know, it sounded exciting, but, uh... you know, we, we don't wanna intrude..."
Thanks for understanding.
"Oh... Oh, okay. Well, uh, I'll see ya."
"Bye, Moe."


"Yep, the old quarry is just a stone's throw away."
"Stop saying that, Dad."
Never!
"Hey, there's Mesmerino."
Seventeen seventy-six. How much is left in my checking account?

This is it. This is the old quarry.

Maybe we should come back in the daytime.
Someone's yellow belly is showing.
"Oh, sorry."
"Aw, geez. Right in the eyes."
Chief Wiggum!
Who's there? How do you... How do you know my name?!
"It's us, the Simpsons."
"Oh. I saw your car by the gate and I, well I thought you might be lost hikers. 'Cause then I could rescue you, and-and be a hero, and-and maybe the city would give me a coupon for free guitar lessons ha."
So what are you doin' here?
We're investigating a possible murder case.
"Oh, you mind if I tag along? I'm kind of a crime buff."

"If there's a body in here, we'll drag it up."
"Ah heck, it's just an old shopping cart."
And it's empty. Put it back! I don't wanna see it this way.
Let's wait in the car.
We'll never find the body under all this water.
"Water, eh?"

Burly to the rescue!
"Oh, that is so cool."
"Hey, what's that over there?"
"Aw, don't get excited. It's just a skull-shaped rock and a buncha white sticks."
It's the body!
And someone has eaten the flesh.
But whose body is it?
And who sent it down that pipe?

"Now do you believe dead rats float, Lisa?"
Yes.

"Well, looks like the end of the line."
That means our murderer could be on the other side of this hatch.

What are you doing in my corpse-hatch?
"Montgomery Burns, you're under arrest for murder."
Did I say corpse-hatch? I meant innocence tube.
Then how do you explain this?
"I've been expecting this day for thirty years. In a way, it's a relief. But in another way, it's most unwelcome."
"All right, quit stallin', Burns. Who'd you ice?"
"I'm afraid that skull belongs to my dear friend... Waylon Smithers, Sr."
Mr. Smithers' father!
But I did not murder him.
And I can prove it...
With this film.
"Ooh, a movie! I call the couch!"

"If you see only one film this year that proves my innocence, make it this one."

Why are these numbers so high? Why is that red light flashing?
Who cares?
"And what's that alarming sound? Smithers, get in here! Smithers!"
"Sorry, Monty. I was feeding Waylon Jr."
Will you put that baby down? There's something wrong with the reactor core.
I better go in and have a look.
"No, Waylon Senior! It could be filled with atoms and steam and other nuclear bric-a-brac."
"If this reactor blows, the whole town is doomed, including my son."
So... you're a baby huh? How's that working out for you?
He did it!
Look at your heroic daddy in there.
Making funny faces. Falling to the floor. Shedding his hair. Lying perfectly still...
Oh dear.
Sir...
"Smithers Sr. gave his life to save the plant. And, since cover-ups were all the rage back then, I shoved his heroic corpse down the sewer pipe. I never told Smithers the truth about his father."
"Until tonight, sir."
Smithers Jr.!
"Ha, busted!"
"Now the movie's turned into a play! Still good, though."
"I'm sorry I lied to you, Waylon, but I wanted to spare you the details of your father's gruesome death."
"Well, I'm glad to know he died a hero, instead of that other way."
I told him his father was killed in the Amazon by a tribe of savage women.
I hope it didn't affect you in any way.
"We'll never know, sir."

"Well Marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
"Homer, shouldn't we give that skull to Mr. Smithers?"
Why? He'd just bury it.
"Lisa, don't sulk. You're on the Jumbotron."
"Hey, hey, I found a clue that's gonna bust your mystery wide open!"
"Sorry, we already solved it."
"Oh. Well, you wanna take a look at it anyways, uh just for ha-has?"
Seems kinda pointless now.
"Yeah I guess you're right. It's just that I, you know, went to a lot of trouble, you know makin' the envelope and everything..."
"Let's see what you have, Moe."
"Okay, now this first thing is just gonna look like a used Band Aid. And it is. But the rest of this stuff won't make no sense without it. So uh, bear with me."
"Wow Moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
"Oh yeah, oh yeah, I sleuthed my ass off on this one."
"Okay, this is a number six from somebody's address. Or is it a nine? You don't know. Uh, this is gravel. Okay? Gravel. This is uh, that's more gravel. Okay, oh. This is a shell, that to me -- this is just me talkin', it looks like a helmet for a mouse... Now, that sounds crazy, right. But if you ask a mice about it, they don't say nothin'. I mean they run the other way. At first I was just fishin' with the helmet thing. But then from the mouse's reaction I got, I got a little more concerned."
Did you really make that envelope? 'Cause it says Hammermill over here.
"Ummm, no."
"We now return to ""The Planet from Outer Space."""

"Captain, we've been attacked by some sort of force ray. Space air is flooding in!"
Right. Goggles on!
Good Lord! We're on a collision course with a monster -- from space!


That's just a dog in a space suit.
"From the looks of it, a male dog."
We'll return to our film after these very loud messages.
"Hi, I'm Colonel Chet Manners, five-time space shuttle alternate."
Lo-ser.
/ Adorable.
"Do you want to boldly go where people like me, but not me, have gone before? Then get the Orbit King -- with yaw control like you've never seen!"
"Hey Lis, is Dad's credit card number 5784365343410709?"
You know it is.
"WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD."
"Hey Dad, will you help me build this model rocket?"
"Just a second, son. I've gotta put on my contacts."
I didn't know your dad was so interested in science.
Science!?
"Uh, he didn't say science... he said ""pie pants."""
"Mmmm, pie pants."
"This is Launch Master Homer, counting down. Five, four, three..."
Two... one...
My eyebrows. My beautiful eyebrows!
"Over here, Guv'nor."
"The word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but I think I can say with confidence..."
"Okay, that shows you what could potentially happen."
What was that?
"Greetings from Nedily Space Center on Cape Flandaveral. We noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. Ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"
"Wow, did you see that yaw control?"
"I have eyes, don't I?"
I would really like to thank you nerds for helping me out.
"Well, then, could you stop calling us nerds?"
"Dweeb, wonk, spaz... it's all good."
Who wants some Astro-lemonade?
What precisely makes it Astro?
"Look, I don't want to start a whole thing with this."
"Okay, the rocket's ready to go."

"Super. Now if you'll gather around, I'd like to say a few words. All nerds clear the launch area."
"Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, where's America's newest hero?"
He's saying goodbye to his wife.
"Oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
She already ate three.
"Oh, that's sensible."
"Son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God."
"Five, four, three, two, one... COUNTDOWN!"


"Wow, that's it. I'm off the hooch."
Hey! Wine!

"Dad, the rocket's off course!"
"Okay Nibbles, you can guide her down. Step one: Right in front of you is a blue handle. Pull for a controlled burn of two point four seconds..."



Now it's headed for the church.
"Don't worry, I planned for this."


This is the worst thing you've ever done.
You say that so much it's lost all meaning.

I have convened the Church Council to see what we should do now.
Fixing all that damage is gonna be very expensive.
"Yes, barring some sort of miracle..."
"All right, we'll help ourselves, yet again. People, we need some fund-raising ideas."
Let's just write to David Bowie again.
"Oh, he's done enough for this church. Anyone else?"

I've got the answer. Just let me run this church like a business.
"It's kind of you to offer, Mr. Burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
"Well, at least it's tasteful."
"Oh, that's just a skip-rope rhyme. Believe me, the Lord's gonna go for this in a big way. Now, who's with me?"
"Oh, I guess we have no choice."
Excellent.
"Oh, you'll get yours."

This is Lindsay Naegle. And don't let the skirt fool you -- she'll have this place making money in no time.
Isn't that skirt a little north of the knee.
You're telling me!
"I guarantee I can find some new revenue streams. Step one: let's sell some ad space. Reverend, how would you feel about wearing this robe?"
Hmmm. Conflicted.
Too bad. You've already signed the deal!
"Actually, he hasn't."
"Oh. Well, we highly value your input. Until you sign the deal!"
"Let me handle this, Monty."
Good idea. I'll be hiding behind that tree.

What are they doing to the church?
We're re-branding it. The old church was skewing pious. We prefer a faith-based emporium teeming with impulse-buy items.
I feel like I want to throw up.
Then my work is done.

Why does Jesus have a lasso?
'Cause he's all man.
"Money changed! Get your money changed, right here in the temple!"
That could not be more blasphemous.
Where's Bart?
Do a nice one for Grandma.
Fine.
These new pews are so comfy.
I am not gonna be taken in by all of this.

"And Lord, please remember our infirm parishioners, especially Mrs. Glick, who's recovering from hip surgery. And now let us rise and, um, um..."

He's not gonna say it.
"Trust me, he'll say it, or I'll bust him down to Thursday night vespers."
"...and thank Crazy Larry, whose Big-Screen TV prices are insane-ane-ane! And now to deliver a special sermon on the sanctity of deliciousness... the Noid!"
That's it!
"Quiet, Lisa. Everyone in the store is looking at you!"
"They should take a good look at themselves, and what their church has become!"

"Lisa, it's still the same basic message. We've just dressed it up a little."
Like the whore of Babylon?
That is a false analogy.
"No it's not, it's apt! Apt!"

Don't you see what Mr. Burns has done to this church?
He restored it from nave to narthex.
He super-sized the pews for the zaftig believers.
He put ice in the urinals.
"Those are all wonderful things. But they've cost the church its soul. And I, for one, will not be a part of it!"
Do you want your hand stamped so you can come back in?
No! I'm leaving this church forever!

Oh no...
I don't know how to feel.
You should be very upset.
Got it.
How was that?
A little much.




"Lord, I'm not turning my back on You. I just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
Why do you have to be so different? Always making a big deal out of everything.
"Mom, I know it's you."
I can't believe you're eavesdropping on my prayers!
"Oh honey, I'm worried about your soul. I want at least one person from this family to go to Heaven."
"I still believe in God. I just think there's another path to Him, or Her."
"Her?! She's just kidding, Mr. Lord."


Still lookin' for a new faith?
Yep.
"Hey, how 'bout one of those religions where you eat a human heart?"
No.
How 'bout Methodist?
"No! Look, I'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. I'm gonna pick one that's right for me."
"How 'bout Judaism? When you turn thirteen, cha-ching."
I'm going out for a walk.


Lenny and Carl?
You guys are Buddhists?
"Oh yeah, if I didn't have inner peace, I'd completely go psycho on all you guys all the time."
"Well, I'm looking for a new faith. One that isn't so materialistic."
"Well, you've come to the right place."
Buddhism teaches that suffering is caused by desire.
Richard Gere?
"Ooh, the world's most famous Buddhist."
What about the Dalai Lama?
Who?
"You know, the fourteenth reincarnation of the Buddha Avalokitesvara."
Who's Buddha?
"Hey Simpson, I hear your sister dumped Christianity."
It's a good thing Buddhism teaches freedom from desire. 'Cause I've got the desire to kick your ass.
"Mr. Gere, I was hoping Buddhism could bring me inner peace. Or is that just a pipe dream?"
We all have dreams. Mine is of a free Tibet.
That would be so great.
I dream about meatball sandwiches. All you can eat for two bucks.
Good luck. This pamphlet contains the teachings of the Buddha -- all things are impermanent and are empty of inherent existence.
"Hey Richard, in ""An Officer and A Gentleman"" did you really do all those sit-ups?"
"I wish. I did one, then they just showed it a thousand times."

"""Nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... Positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... No creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""
I'm a Buddhist!

"Hey, I'm a Buddhist!"
"My Satan sense is tingling! Into the root cellar, boys!"
When can we come out?
Maybe never.
Yayyy!

"So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as you're in my house, you'll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!"
"Yes, father."
"Mom, Dad, my spiritual quest is over..."
"Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy."
"But Dad, my heart hurts."
I'm a Buddhist.
Wha?! That's it. No more chat rooms for you.
"You know, Lisa, around here, Buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
A Buddhist wouldn't want any.
Me so litigious.
"I'll tell you someone who cares. He's got long hair, works as a carpenter, has a lot of ""crazy"" ideas about love and brotherhood."
His name's Gunnar and he's datin' my Mom. Sometimes he buys us beer.
I thought Kearney was dating your Mom.
"Hey, she came on to me."
Get him!

"Hey Lisa, what are you doing?"
"I'm planting my own Bodhi tree. If I meditate under it, perhaps I can find inner peace."
"Honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like you?"
No.
Good. I'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you is not worth your time.
Om Mani Padme Hung. Om Mani Padme Hung. Om Mani Padme Hung.
You're gonna get a bath tonight.

"So the good news is, church revenues are up one thousand and seventy-three percent."
And when will the church see any of this money?
"When hell freezes over, suckers!"
"Oh whatever, just take it."
"Well, next on our agenda, Marge Simpson's devil daughter."
She's not a devil. I just don't know what to do.
"Well, Christmas is coming, huh?"
"Yeah, and Santa doesn't leave presents under the Bodhi tree."
You think we can bribe her back with Christmas?
"Marge, you can save more souls with roller skates and Easy Bake Ovens than with this two thousand page sleeping pill."
Time to begin Operation Xmas-Remind of-How good is.
Just do it. Do it. Do it now!
I think this tree could use an angel.
It's go time.
"I was just making Christmas cookies. But since you don't believe in Christmas anymore, I guess you don't want any."
"Well, they do smell good..."
Hm. It's a pity.
All right! Trash cookies!
Uh-oh. I think I ate a dog food lid.
Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...
WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH...
"Oh. Hello, Lisa."
I just came down for a glass of water.
"Ah. Well, you do have a present under the tree. I guess no one told Santa you were a Buddhist."
"Well, Santa can take it back because I'm not ruled by material desi-- Is that a pony?"
I don't know what Santa left you. I just know his name is Clip-Clop and he loves sugar.
"Lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
Awww...
Lick it... Lick it...
No!
Oh no! Our daughter's run away on Christmas Eve.
"More sugar, please."
Bag's in the kitchen.
All right!
My family tried to trick me into celebrating Christmas!
"You know, we are meditating."
"Oh, sorry."
That's all right. I was only about to achieve enlightenment. But who'd want that?
Who likes short shorts?
I like short shorts.
"Those guys are way off. Anyway, your family didn't have to trick you. Buddhists respect the diversity of other religions as long as they're based on love and compassion."
Whaa?
It's true. So why don't you go home. I'm sure your family really misses you.
